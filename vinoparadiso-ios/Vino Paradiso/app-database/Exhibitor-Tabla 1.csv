Croquembouche Patisserie;"Croquembouche Pâtisserie was founded in December 2000 by Frederic and Laurence Caillon. Thanks to the support of the local community in Banksmeadow and Botany, the word soon spread around about ‘this new cake place’ and the rest is history. After six months, Croquembouche outgrew its premises and moved into a larger shop at 1635 Botany Rd, the current address. The addition of tables and chairs has allowed customers to enjoy an espresso or cup of tea with their cakes or savoury treats.
Today, Croquembouche is one of the busiest French Patisseries in Sydney and customers come from as far as Cronulla and Palm Beach.";http://www.croquembouche.com.au/;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Croquembouche-Patisserie/340360986040241;;http://instagram.com/croquembouchepatisserie;
Bream Creek Wines;Overlooking the breathtaking seascape of Marion Bay and Maria Island in South Eastern Tasmania, Bream Creek is one of the first commercial vineyards planted in Tasmania. In August 1990, the vineyard was purchased by Fred Peacock - one of Tasmania’s leading viticulturalists. Fred’s priority was to increase Pinot Noir plantings and introduce Sauvignon Blanc and Schonburger (the first commercial plantings in the Southern Hemisphere.) The Riesling vines are now over 40 years old, some of the oldest commercial vines in Tasmania. With Fred’s dedication and passion, the vineyard is now a 7.5 hectare showcase of premium Tasmanian varieties.;http://www.breamcreekvineyard.com.au;https://www.facebook.com/breamcreekwines;https://twitter.com/BreamCkVineyard;http://instagram.com/Breamcreekvinyard;

MAGGIE McKEEVERS;"Fresh, delicious, honest food made lovingly by hand for busy people. Our mission is to change pre-conceptions of pre-prepared meals, indulge a love of home-style comfort food and carry on our Nan's generosity of spirit. By providing freshly made meals from family recipes, we hope to take the pressure off busy people and give them more time to spend doing whatever makes them happy – the more frivolous the better! What three words come to mind when you think of pre-prepared meals? If those words are not fresh, handmade and delicious, then you have never tried Maggie McKeever’s. Maggie’s meals don’t come from a factory. They’re made lovingly by hand in their specialized kitchen using only the freshest of ingredients.

The inspiration for Maggie’s meals came from the home recipes of Peter Graham’s Irish grandmother and the motivation, from the lack of quality ready meals he could find on the way home at the end of a busy day. Peter decided there had to be a better option for others who want good home-style food without losing precious time preparing it. So he gave up his corporate job to start Maggie McKeever’s – a brave step, as wife Kate was pregnant with their first child at the time. 

“I grew up sharing the most incredible family gatherings around the table, eating good food and having meaningful conversations. Our mission is to give some extra time back to people so they can do whatever makes them happy. That's what Maggie McKeever's is all about,"" smiles Peter Graham, Maggie McKeever’s Big Chief.

From humble beginnings in their home kitchen in 2012 providing individual meals to office workers in the city, Maggie’s soon moved into a larger kitchen in Brookvale. They took on weekend markets where they continue to build a loyal following, and carefully selected retail stockists that fit with their brand. Now available from Thomas Dux Grocer in Sydney and Melbourne, as well as a growing number of stores with Harris Farm Markets, IGA and boutique foodie delis and markets throughout Sydney. 

Maggie’s range is small so they can concentrate on quality handmade meals, while still supplying their growing list of stockists. From unique family recipes such as the 'Signature Homebake' with chicken, peaches and broccoli, to 'The G' – a vegetarian lasagne brimming with flavour that many say is as good as any they’ve tasted. Maggie McKeever’s meals are perfect for busy mums, fussy kids, corporate workers, retired people who want something better, in fact for anyone with a busy life who loves good, home-style food. Some meals are even gluten free. 

Maggie McKeever’s will change many people’s pre-conceptions of pre-prepared meals.";http://www.maggiemckeevers.com.au;https://www.facebook.com/maggiemckeevers;https://twitter.com/maggiemckeevers;http://instagram.com/maggiemckeevers;
Clover Hill Wines;"Discover the essence of Tasmania. Discover the elegance of Clover Hill.  Established in 1986, on the site of an old dairy farm, Clover Hill was the first vineyard in Tasmania to dedicate itself to the production of sparkling wines, exclusively growing the ""holy trinity"" of varieties: chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier. 

Owner John Goelet, a direct descendant of the Guestier wine merchant family of Bordeaux, discovered the site after a worldwide search for a sparkling wine estate.

Clover Hill is a boutique Tasmanian sparkling house. It is dedicated to the production of méthode-traditionnelle sparkling wines, exclusively growing the chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meuniere. 

Clover Hill’s award-winning wines have garnered critical acclaim since the winery’s inception in 1986, winning the hearts of even the most royal among us. Clover Hill was selected as one of only four iconic Australian wines to be served to Her Majesty The Queen and His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh during their most recent Australian visit. Prior to that, it was the tipple of choice at Princess Mary’s and Prince Frederik’s wedding celebrations. 

Clover Hill was awarded the inaugural Tasmanian Vineyard of the Year and, since then, has continued to collect gold trophies and awards from some of Australia’s most prestigious wine shows and competitions. 

Clover Hill’s Signature Labels

Born from…

I blame my father.  35 years ago he went to a wine tasting evening class, there was not enough people to hold the course, so he and a few others started their own. They’ve been tasting wine every Wednesday since.

That was what I was born into, a family that pretty much centered around the table.  Or to be precise the fridge.  Food and wine were all part of the experience.  Very little has changed.

Having traveled the world and studied winemaking, viticulture and wine business in 2012, I decided to get out from behind the corporate desk and continue with the fun part, winemaking and sharing the results with others.  That’s me, David Messum – Winemaker/Owner/Purveyor of Wines from the Other Side.

Born & Raised is based on the simple premise that good things should be shared, you don’t need to follow the herd and that it’s ok to be different.  Born & Raised Wines embodies the things I love about wine so much, diversity,  great people, sociability and above all having a good time.

This spirit was immediately understood by all the international operators and helped them establish some very important partnerships.
With their horse and cart the two brothers used to deliver their Chianti wine to the houses in the surrounding countryside and to the city of Florence as well.

With the third generation, with Vittorio’s sons Pietro and Giovanni, greater focus was placed on the wine making business and the Fratelli Sensi wines became famous throughout Tuscany.
